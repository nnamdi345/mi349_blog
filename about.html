        <h1>Behind the Blog</h1>
        <p>Have you ever felt the need to spread your thoughts but no one would listen? Or even felt the need to spread them but you didn’t want to force anyone to listen? Well that’s what drove me to create this blog. This blog is a place for me to give a raw uncut look into my thoughts and share them with the rest of you, hopefully provoking discussions.</p>
        <p class="pic"><img src="nnam.jpg" alt="Picture of Nnamdi Iroha"></p>
        <p>My name is Nnamdi Iroha and I was born June 23, 1998 in Detroit, Michigan. Currently, I am a senior at Michigan State University studying media and information looking to focus on policy and research. Growing up with my sister and both parents, there has always been someone in the house to talk to so I never resorted to writing. Contradictory to the focus of my major which requires a lot of reading and writing, writing has never been my favorite thing to do, but it provides an outlet to express yourself and that feeling is enjoyable. With that being said, I would like to thank you for visiting my blog and welcome into the mind of a Nnamdi.</p>
